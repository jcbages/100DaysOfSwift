# Project 4: Easy Browser
This project consists of a simple web browser using `WKWebView`. It has two websites to select from and render taking the entire device screen.
The options are on a `UITableViewController` listing the URLs. There's a navigation toolback showing back/forward, progress bar,
and refresh buttons below using `UIBarButtonItem`.
