# Project 3: Consolidation II
This project was a reinforcement over the concepts I learmed of previous lessons. There's a `UITableViewController` displaying
a list of countries. By tapping a cell you'll get an image of the country's flag and the option to share both the flag image and
the country name using an `UIActivityViewController`.
