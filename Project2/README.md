# Project 2: Guess the Flag
This project consists of a game about guessing which flag correspond to a certain country. You are given a group of 3 `UIButton`,
each one displaying some random flag image. You need to tap on the flag you consider is the corrent one and you'll get `+1` to your
score if you answer correctly, and `-1` otherwise.

Some interesting things I used this time were the `UIAlertController` for displaying alert messages, and `UIAlertAction` as a button
for dismissing the alert. I also changed the `CALayer` for the buttons so that I was able to add some borders.
