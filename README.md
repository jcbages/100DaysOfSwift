# 100DaysOfSwift
100 Days of Swift is a challenge made by Paul Hudson from the [Hacking With Swift website](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). This is my progress into that.
I skipped days 1-15 as they were Swift only. Also, I'll post my progress and learning every day on Twitter [@jcbages](https://twitter.com/jcbages).
